## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo = TRUE, results= 'hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
In this step I am loading the dplyr package to help me later on as well as reading the activty datset into a dataframe.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
Stepsgroup <- group_by(activity, date)
totalSteps <- summarise(Stepsgroup, TotalSteps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
hist(totalSteps$TotalSteps)

meanSteps <- mean(totalSteps$TotalSteps)
medianSteps <- median(totalSteps$TotalSteps)
#Mean
print(meanSteps)
#Median
print(medianSteps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
IntervalGroup <- group_by(activity, interval)
intSteps <- summarise(IntervalGroup, avgInt = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

plot(intSteps$interval, intSteps$avgInt, type= "l")
```


## Imputing missing values
```{r}

```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
